🌐 Integra Magna – Landing Page UI
Hi! 👋
This is my submission for the Integra Magna Web Developer Task. The goal was to build a responsive and interactive landing page based on a given design reference, with an emphasis on clean structure, attention to detail, and engaging user experience.

📌 Project Overview
⚙️ Built with: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

🌗 Features a smooth Dark/Light Mode toggle

✨ Includes micro-interactions: hover effects, animated cards, and button transitions

🪄 Adds scroll-based animations for dynamic content reveals

📱 Fully responsive using CSS Grid and Flexbox

🎨 Designed with a modern, minimal, and user-first approach

💡 My Thought Process
Structure First:
I began by breaking the UI into semantic sections: Navbar, Hero, Features, and Footer.

Mobile-First Design:
The layout scales well from small devices up to desktops, using responsive units and flexible grids.

Dark Mode (Bonus):
A simple theme toggle with classList.toggle was added. CSS custom properties (--bg, --text, etc.) made switching themes seamless.

Interaction Enhancements (Bonus):

Hover effects on buttons and cards

Reveal-on-scroll animation for smooth user onboarding

Accessibility Considerations:
Colors and fonts were chosen for contrast and readability.

🎯 Bonus Features Implemented
🌗 Dark / Light Mode Toggle with smooth transition

🖱️ Hover Animations on buttons and cards

🪄 Reveal-on-scroll Animation for section content

📱 Responsive Layout using grid and flex

🧩 Challenges Faced
Getting the scroll-based animation to work consistently across screen sizes.

Maintaining contrast and visual hierarchy between dark and light themes.
