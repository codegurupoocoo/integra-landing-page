# 🚀 Integra Magna – Landing Page Challenge

Hi there! 👋  
This is my submission for the Web Developer Task assigned by Integra Magna. The goal was to build a modern, responsive landing page based on a reference design, with a focus on UI/UX, clean structure, and interactivity.

---

## 🧠 Thought Process & Approach

I started by planning out the structure of the page—keeping things simple, semantic, and clean using HTML5 elements like `<header>`, `<section>`, and `<footer>`. The layout was handled using CSS Flexbox and Grid to ensure responsiveness across devices.

I chose a **dark theme** by default to match modern design trends, and also added a **toggle** for switching to light mode. This switch uses CSS variables and JavaScript for smooth transitions between the themes.

## ✨ Key Features

- 🌗 **Dark/Light Mode Toggle** – A button in the navbar lets users switch themes with a smooth transition.
- 📱 **Responsive Design** – The layout adjusts gracefully on mobile, tablet, and desktop.
- 🖱️ **Hover Interactions** – Buttons and cards have subtle hover effects to enhance user experience.
- ⚡ **Clean Code** – The entire project is built with HTML, CSS, and a little JavaScript—no frameworks.

## 🧪 Challenges Faced

- Getting the dark/light mode to transition smoothly without flicker.
- Balancing contrast and readability for both themes.
- Making sure everything remained aligned and centered on very small screen sizes.

## 📁 How to Run the Project

1. Download or clone the repository.
2. Open the `index.html` file in any browser.
3. Click the **"Toggle Mode"** button to switch between themes.
